## How to Scaffold a New Project Locally with your CLI (rebble_mod)
1. Run scaffold command directly (no install needed)
From your CLI tool folder (where rebble_mod lives), run:
```bash
python3 -m rebble_mod.cli scaffold <ProjectName>
```


2. Install CLI package in editable mode (optional, for convenience)
Inside your CLI project root (where setup.py is), run:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
This installs rebble_mod globally (or in your active env).

The -e flag means changes to your source code reflect immediately without reinstalling.

Once installed, you can run the CLI command anywhere:

```bash
rebble-mod scaffold MyTestProject
````

3. Reinstalling / updating your CLI tool<br>
To reinstall and overwrite the previous install (useful after code changes):

```bash
pip3 install --user --force-reinstall </full/path/to/rebble-mod-cli>
```
This installs the CLI for your current user (--user).

Make sure your CLI script (rebble-mod) is linked correctly.

4. Ensure CLI script is in your shell’s PATH
If you see warnings like:

```pgsql
WARNING: The script rebble-mod is installed in '/Users/barbara/Library/Python/3.11/bin' which is not on PATH.
Make sure the directory is added to your PATH environment variable.
```

Example for zsh (~/.zshrc):

```zsh
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.11/bin:$PATH"
```
Then reload your shell environment:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
or just open a new terminal window.

5. Using a setup script for environment variables (Optional)
If your CLI depends on other tools (like rebbletool binaries), create a POSIX shell script (e.g. setup-rebble-env.sh):

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Rebble environment setup — works in bash, zsh, dash, etc.

REB_PATH="$HOME/.rebbletool/rebbletool/bin"
export PATH="$REB_PATH:$PATH"
```
Then users can run:

```bash
source </path/to/setup-rebble-env.sh>
```
This injects the correct PATH into the current shell session.

It works across different POSIX shells.

6. Additional tips
Your setup.py should have a console_scripts entry point for the CLI (rebble-mod=rebble_mod.cli:main).

Your CLI script should parse arguments and dispatch commands like scaffold.

Packaging this way makes your tool easy to install and use.

Consider documenting this flow in your README.

Du:
häh??? all works perfectly fine if installed I can do
rebble-mod scaffold MyTestProject

and
rebble-mod addModule <path/to/project> <path/to/module>
